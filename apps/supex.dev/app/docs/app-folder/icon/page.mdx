# Icon

Use `app/icon.(svg|png|jpg)` to set the icon of the extension. If `png` or `jpg` is used, make sure the image has a minimum width of `512px`. Supex will generate the icon in different sizes during the build process.
Please see the [icon guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/images#icons) on Chrome Webstore page for best practices.
